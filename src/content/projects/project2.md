This is a project written in vanilla Javascript utilizing webpack as the asset manager. This project makes an api call to weatherapi.com and then parses the data returned and displays it in a clean manner. A toggle for Celsius and Farenheit temperatures has also been included for those who are used to metric. The background image changes based on the weather conditions of the location searched.

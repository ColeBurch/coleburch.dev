Version 3.3 of Matplotlib changed a parameter name and required updates to the documentation. I updated the documentation to align with the new names and submitted a pull request to the Matplotlib repository. The pull request was accepted and merged into the main branch. The changes I made are now live on the Matplotlib documentation website.

Discussion with Zulip customers raised the issue of renaming some custom profile fields to more accurately reflect their purpose. I updated the settings names, reordered them alphabetically in the app UI, and updated the documentation to reflect the changes. The changes were submitted as a pull request to the Zulip repository and were accepted and merged into the main branch. The changes I made are now live on the Zulip app and documentation website.
